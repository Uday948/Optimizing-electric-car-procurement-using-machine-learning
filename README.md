# Optimizing-electric-car-procurement-using-machine-learning
The shift towards sustainable transportation has seen a surge in the demand for electric
vehicles (EVs) across the globe. However, with a plethora of options available, users often face challenges in selecting the most suitable EV that aligns with their preferences and requirements.
    This project aims a novel procurement solution designed to assist users in optimizing their selection of electric cars based on their specific features and preferences. This project employs machine learning algorithms and data analytics to analyze user input regarding desired features, such as range, price range, and performance metrics. Leveraging a comprehensive database of electric vehicles to match user preferences with the most suitable electric vehicles available on the market.
Elucidating the nuanced interplay between income levels and Electric Vehicles preferences, our project aims to advance sustainable transportation solutions and mitigating environmental impacts associated with conventional fossil fuel vehicles The proposed project integrates Machine learning algorithms to discern the influential features in Electric Vehicles selection across income levels. This project provides personalized recommendations and fostering informed decision-making in the transition to electric mobility.
